## The way I thought to show the posts

1. Write in the markdown files.
2. Copy the files to dist.
3. Create folders named as the files and move the files to the folders.
4. Rename all these files to index.html.
5. Save the file list to some place.
6. Copy the list to dist too.
7. Deploy on server.
8. Fetch the list file on broswer.
9. Fetch the markdown file you need.
10. Show it with showdownjs.
